The Hack RF, Portapack is a new piece of kit for my Amateur Radio (HAM) collection.
I know shit about how to use this device but I do have HAM experience with Software Defined Radio <<SDR>>.
Maybe something I document here will help others.

== Introduction

I purchased a HackRF Portapack device from AliExpress in September 2022.  
SDR radio has been a pastime of mine and I wanted a device I could use stand-alone, without a Tablet or PC.

As with any new device, there is a learning curve, which if documented will help me in 6 months when I come back to this.
This is a pseudo blog article but, without any real concern for Grammar, spelling, and the like.  
Its content is raw and simple.  Copies of any files, videos, manuals, or other information will be available from this document.

[NOTE]
This document was created using Visual Studio Code and a Markup/Markdown language known as ASCIIDoctor <<ADOC>>.
This is my primary way of writing documentation, blogs, and instructions.
I am not a writer, I am an engineer, and pride myself in not using Word for this type of work.
I have quite a bit of assets to help using this documentation toolchain easier.

== Instructions

As expected there was one page of instructions see Link
There were pretty much useless.
The Aliexpress link had a paragraph on how to start the LONG journey for instructions.

REFERENCE: Telegram Software link  https://t.me/OpenSourceSDRLab[Telegram, window=_new]

REFERENCE: Telegram group link https://t.me/joinchat/MrUQFRcNG0xjYTg1[Telegram SDR Group Link, window=_new]

 
In order to get instructions, you have to install <<Telegram>> on your mobile device and your PC and link them together using QR Codes
and wave a dead chicken above your head while reciting the magic unknown words.
<<Telegram>> is not the most secure messaging as it requests access to your phone numbers and contacts.

.Telegram Security

REFERENCE:  What data can Government get from https://www.telemessage.com/what-data-can-government-agencies-get-from-encrypted-services-such-as-whatsapp-telegram-and-imessage/[Telegram Security,window=_new]

My plan is to get the damn manual and bail from <<Telegram>>.

Your message should include order information probably because they don't want the instructions getting out in the Open.
I will take care of that by including a link to those instructions from this document, for anyone in the Open to use them.
What part of `OpenSource SDR` means the instructions need to be secured?

== Turn HackRF off

Nothing in the one-page instructions indicated how to turn the HackRF off.
Turns out it is something simple, just double-click on the rotary dial, duh.

There are a set of Command snippets for quickly entering blocks of ASCIIDoc code
using Ctrl-Space-z which call us a list of the ASCIIDOC
